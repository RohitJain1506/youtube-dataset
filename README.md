Project's Title-

Youtube channel dataset.


Project Description-

Firstly We created a new repositorty here,give it a name README and markdown file as "Readme.md".

Project Report-

We have a Youtube channel dataset which we coded in python and then we imported that datset in Github.We used a dataset showing the top 4000 YouTube channels based on subscribers. We used the “iloc” command, which is integer index based to create a function to calculate the distribution of channeltype from the top 1000 records.Subsequently, we showed that distribution in a bar graph as can be seen in the code output.Finally, we loaded only the top 1000 records of the original 4000 into a separate CSV file.The Pandas website article on iloc functions was particularly of help in solving these questions.
