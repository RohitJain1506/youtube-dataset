Youtube channel dataset coded in python is imported in Github. The dataset includes 4000 observations showing the top 4000 YouTube channels based on subscribers. The python code uses the “iloc” command, which is integer index based to create a function to calculate the distribution of channeltype from the top 1000 records which is visually shown through Bar Graph.Finally, the top 1000 records of the original 4000 were loaded into a separate CSV file.
